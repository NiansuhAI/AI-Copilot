## Introduce
- ⭐ Based on Microsoft New Bing, Microsoft New Bing website is simply customized with Vue3 and Go. It has a consistent user interface experience, supports ChatGPT prompts, is out of the box, and is essentially compatible with all Microsoft Bing AI functionality. Can chat without logging in.

- ⭐ As the official Bing chat server (relatively fast and stable, recommended), you can refer to the following solutions

- ⭐ Chat server (default is "Good server"). The number of requests is limited to 100,000 per day. It can be toggled in Settings => Service selection in the upper right corner.

- ⭐ Available (deployment server directly connected to www.bing.com without CN redirection and connection configurable)

- ⭐ Supports existing open source ChatGPT prompt vocabulary

- ⭐ When you need advanced functions like drawing, etc. (you need to give orders).

- ⭐ If you encounter any problems, click the bottom left corner first! Try, if it doesn't work, use the refresh method (Shift + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R or settings in the upper right corner and select clear cookies) and the last tip is to clear cache and cookies of the browser, such as (24-hour limit, not logged in reminder, etc.)

- ⭐ Requires selecting Creative Conversation Mode
